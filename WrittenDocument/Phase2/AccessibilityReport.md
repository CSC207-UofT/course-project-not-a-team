Question 1: For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principle 1: Equitable Use<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the project, we developed a farm simulation game that is suitable for users from all age ranges and races. There is no discriminations against any group or minority in he game. For every player, the game provides exactly the same features and GUI. Therefore, our program adheres to Principle 1: Equitable Use.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principle 2: Flexibility in Use<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our program accommodates a wide range of individual abilities: 1. The high contrast between the background and the information makes the game easier for players with amblyopia. 2. Because of our GUI design, the program is equally easy for right- and left-handed access and use. 3. In our program, color blindness will not affect the usage. Therefore, our program adheres to Principle 2: Flexibility in Use.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have designed a GUI for our game, which eliminates unnecessary complexities when playing the game. We have implemented images and graphs for buttons and entities, thus the player does not need to have high literacy to play the game. Also, all the message boxes contain only English that is from daily usage. Therefore, our program adheres to Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principle 4: Perceptible Information<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of GUI, we have made the background white and the information black, providing high contrast between essential information and its surroundings. Different objects are separated by different images; and there remains adequate space between each object. Therefore, our program adheres to Principle 4: Perceptible Information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principle 5: Tolerance for Error<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When developing the game, we have covered most of the cases the player may encounter as he or she plays the game. In each of the situations, there will be a message box that jumps to the screen and provides the player with additional instructions. Also, the buttons will become unclickable when the player has already clicked on the button and attempts a second click, which minimizes the error as the program interacts with the database. Therefore, our program adheres to Principle 5: Tolerance for Error. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principle 6: Low Physical Effort<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The players can play our farm game on the phone, meaning that no specific body position is required for playing the game. The player can perform all kinds of actions with just one or two clicks. Besides, we have added a feature to purchase and sell multiple seeds with one click in order to minimize repetitive actions for purchasing and selling products. Therefore, our program adheres to Principle 6: Low Physical Effort.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because as we develop the game, we made all buttons(including items and sign buttons) reasonably large, the players can reach all components with one hand. And there are no specific gesture combinations required for performing actions. Therefore, our program adheres to Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use.

Question 2: Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We would market our program toward people who like simulation games. Our farm game allows the player to play as a farmer and builds his or her own farm. Players can plant crops such as cucumber, corn, and broccoli, and more plants will be unlocked as the player levels up. As the plant grows, the player will be able to water and fertilize the plant to keep the plant in growing status.  When the plants mature, players can harvest the plants and sell those plants back to the store to earn money and expand the farm.

Question 3: Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our farm game is not restricted by demographics. Due to the universal principle 1, the players from all regions, genders, and races can play our farm game without facing any limitation. And from the universal principle 3, people with low literacy can easily play our farm game since we have implemented pictures for all buttons and items. One exception is that blind people may not be able to play because we have not yet added the audio version of the game.
