Connor(Jingquan Cao):

    I am working mainly on LandManager (rewrote part of what we did in Phase 0), and LandSystem.
    The open questions we had right now are not sure how to write tests for controller classes. And
    during phase one, I found observable design patterns really useful in our group project. I might
    add more features on the land system by adding more items.

Zac(Yi Yang):

    I am working mainly on some basic entities. Attribute and method changes always arise during the
    whole process. The question we had is that we are not sure how to test some class that relates
    to the reality of time, the time is changing and we cannot set a “correct” value of time. In the
    next phase we may add other features in our project and change some code based on the feedback
    of phase 1 representations.

Sophie(Saifei Liao):

    I am working on Store, StoreController and Presenters. Since StoreController is closely related
    with PlayerManager, WarehouseManager, it is hard to test StoreController unless we make sure
    PlayerManager, WarehouseManager are correct. Maybe in the next stage, we can consider adding a
    Task System, and when the Player finishes the task, the store can send some free items/seeds to
    the Player.

Severus(Xuhui Chen):

    I am working on the implementation of database and access interfaces of database.
    I am also working on front-end part with Jason, I designed viewModels, the navigation of app
    (from login activity to main activity and tab navigation of fragments inside main activity), and
    I wrote fragments of store and warehouse.

Jason(Yaowei Liu):

    I am working mainly on the front-end of the program with Severus.  I created the page to display
    the lands with its status(locked, unlocked, brought).  Also i have created a popup menu when you
    click on a piece of land, this popup menu contains buttons that perform actions to the land
    (water, plant, harvest, fertilize), when clicked, these buttons call controller methods and
    perform the specified changes to the land.  In the next stage, I plan to make the front end more
    user friendly by adding more graphic instead of text representations we have now.  Also I plan
    to implement the frontend for other extended features added by my teammates.

Harriet(Hanyu Zhu):

    I’m working on the warehouse, warehouse manager, and their tests. Also, I prepared pictures
    that will be used in GUI. Besides, Sophie and I worked together on writing the design document.
    In the next phase, I will help build the UI and I might add more features to our project.
