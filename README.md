This project is team project for Team “Not A Team” of 2021 Fall CSC207. It is a simple farm game.

The .idea folder and gradle files are auto generated by Android Studio, it might look messy but if
they were mis-placed, our project could run into error.

In the written document folder, it contains all our non-code part of different phase (including
specification, progress report, etc)

In the app folder, it contains all our codes. For how our code is organized, see
/WrittenDocument/Phase2’s specification and progress report
