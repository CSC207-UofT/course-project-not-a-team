This project is team project for Team “Not A Team” of 2021 Fall CSC207. It is a simple farm game.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The .idea folder and gradle files are auto generated by Android Studio, it looks messy but </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we tried to put them all in one folder to make github repo look cleaner but it sometimes run </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into error due to Android Studio. </br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the written document folder, it contains all our non-code part of different phase </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including specification, progress report, etc) </br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the app folder, it contains all our codes. </br>
