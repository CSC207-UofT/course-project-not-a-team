This project is team project for Team “Not A Team” of 2021 Fall CSC207. It is a simple farm game.

    The .idea folder and gradle files are auto generated by Android Studio, it looks messy but
    we tried to put them all in one folder to make github repo look cleaner but it sometimes run
    into error due to Android Studio.

    In the written document folder, it contains all our non-code part of different phase
    (including specification, progress report, etc)

    In the app folder, it contains all our codes. For how our code is organized, see
    /WrittenDocument/Phase2’s specification and progress report

Instruction for the game:
    
    Players first enter register interface if it is their first time playing this game, player only
    needs to input a username. Then player can start his/her game by going to store to buy seeds.
    Then player can plant this seed and wait for a period of time to water this plant. After a few
    watering, the seed will grow into a plant for player to harvest. After harvesting, player can
    sell the plant to buy more (and better) seeds while continuing the game.
